**Context** (optional)
The primary objective of this project was to upgrade the [Polkadot Universal App](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-polkadot)  to meet the evolving demands of Substrate-based blockchain networks, especially those with specialized configurations.
This initiative responds to the increasing need for secure hardware wallet support across a broader ecosystemâ€”including projects like [Mythical Games](https://mythicalgames.com/) and the upcoming evolution of AssetHub, currently codenamed "Plaza."
