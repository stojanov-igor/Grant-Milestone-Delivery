**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [Swush Dex Aggregator](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/swush-dex-aggregator.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** (optional)
This is final milestone with full functionality of the application. User now can swap assets between
 Asset Hub and Hydradx and vice versa with slippage control and protection and final transaction is simulated using chopsticks. 

Github repo of code: https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app

#### Pre-requisites before functional testing:
- setup local wallet "Alice" with Polkadot.js extension following steps
 [here](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/docs/get-started/test-wallet-setup.md)

| **0e.** | Article | | Our progress is published at the Documentation section above.
| 1. | **Cross-Chain (XCM) APIs** | [XCM APIs and UI Integration](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/apps/web/src/components/swap/hooks/useAssetConversionSwap.ts) | XCM APIs to transfer and swap assets in a single transaction from Asset Hub to Hydradx and back to Asset Hub.
| 2. | **Asset Balance** | [Balance API and UI Integration](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/apps/web/src/lib/api.ts#L119) | Balance API to fetch user owned assets balance for different asset types like Native and Foreign Assets on Asset Hub.
| 3. | **Slippage Control and Protection** | [Slippage Protection](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/apps/web/src/components/swap/hooks/useAssetConversionSwap.ts#L181-L243) | Slippage control can be viewed in the UI, and for protection we are using dry_run API to simulate the transaction and show if it will succeed or fail. If transaction fails at XCM stage due to slippage, user will be notified of transaction failure.
| 4. | **Real-time Fee Updates** | Preview in UI | Swap rates are updated in output asset price, transaction and xcm fees are pre calculated and added as subtotal and shown at the field "Max Transaction Fee" in the UI.
| 5. | **Asset Pair Swap** | [Swap API and UI Integration](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/apps/web/src/components/swap/hooks/useAssetConversionSwap.ts) | Swap different asset pairs from Hydradx and Polkadot Asset Hub. Hydradx supports limited asset pairs like DOT, USDC, USDT for now.
| 6. | **Optimized Routing** | [Best route selection API](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/packages/api/src/routes/assets.ts#L24-L55) |  Best swap route is selected from multiple routes based on output asset price and slippage tolerance. Currently not including XCM fees as the fees need to be further optimized and fees will come down in upcoming polkadot upgrades.
| 7. | **Chopsticks simulation** | [Chopsticks config](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/tree/dev-v2/packages/chopsticks/config) | Final transaction is simulated with dry_run API before execution and submitted on chopsticks simulated Asset Hub. Asset Hub and Hydradx are configured with chopsticks config for cross chain transactions.
| 8 | **User Transaction History** | [Supabase API](https://github.com/swush-labs/swush-app/blob/dev-v2/apps/web/src/services/swapHistoryService.ts) | Transaction history is stored in Postgres database hosted on Supabase.


**Additional Information**

All of the deliverables above can be viewed in UI at http://localhost:3000/ complementing the APIs implemented.

**Demo video** is available [here](https://www.loom.com/share/236be7c600874b34ad1205e5bdd4c7b8?sid=c2a43645-234a-4e0e-98c3-f763f9cb89bf).

**Note**: Cross chain asset swap via Hydradx takes some time(2-3 minutes), initially after starting the app due to chopsticks block building and XCM transaction processing.

Hydradx limitations: 
- Hydradx supports limited omnipool asset pairs like DOT, USDC, USDT for cross chain swap with XCM in a single call. I raised a feature request to add support for more asset pairs [here](https://github.com/galacticcouncil/hydration-node/issues/1073). Also with upcoming XCM v5 upgrade, we will be able to add more asset pairs.
- NOTE: asset pairs apart from DOT, USDC, USDT are supported for swaps, but it will take multiple XCM calls to transfer and swap assets which we are avoiding as it will increase the fees and complexity and bad UX.

Future scope: </br>
- Add support for more asset pairs.
- Optimize fees for cross chain swap and transaction. Currently fees are high for cross chain swap Asset Hub to Hydradx due to XCM, which is 0.266 DOT which should be reduced in upcoming XCM upgrades.
- Add more parachain support like Moonbeam, with XCM v5 upgrade it will provide a good UX for users. XCM v5 lets user to send assets and perform transactions on parachains in a single call as compared to XCM v4 where two separate calls are required.
- Add cross chain asset swap/transfer beyong Polkadot like Ethereum L2s and L1s like Solana, Sui.
