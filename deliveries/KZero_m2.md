| 0b.    | Documentation             | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c.    | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d.    | Docker                    | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
